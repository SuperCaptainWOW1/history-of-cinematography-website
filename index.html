              In principle, one could simply draw a string of images on a strip
              of paper or a disc. But photography offered the cheapest and most
              efficient way to generate the thousands of images needed for a
              reasonably lengthy display. Thus the invention of photography in
              1826 launched a series of discoveries that made cinema possible.

              In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge, an American photographer, did make a

              cameras with glass plate film and fast exposure, but he was
              primarily interested in freezing phases of an action, not
              re-creating the movement by projecting the images in succession.

          <h2>The rise of the film industry</h2>
        </div>
        <article class="industry-rise__article body">
          <p>
            By 1914, several national film industries were established. Europe,
            Russia and Scandinavia were as important as America. Films became
            longer, and storytelling, or
            <span class="accent-90">narrative</span>, became the dominant form.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As more people paid to see movies, the industry which
            <span class="accent-90">grew</span> around them was prepared to
            <span class="accent-90">invest</span>
            more money in their production, distribution and exhibition, so
            large studios were established and special cinemas built.
            <span class="accent-90">The First World War</span> greatly limited
            the film industry in Europe, and the American industry grew in
            relative importance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first 30 years of cinema were characterised by the growth and
            <span class="sccent-90">consolidation</span> of an industrial base,
            the establishment of the narrative form, and refinement of
            technology.

              <h4><span class="bold">Adding</span> color</h4>
              <p class="body">
                Colour was first added to black-and-white movies through
                tinting, toning and stencilling. By 1906, the principles of
                colour separation were used to produce so-called ‘natural
                colour’ moving images with the British Kinemacolor process,
                first presented to the public in 1909.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The early Technicolor processes from 1915 onwards were
                cumbersome and expensive, and colour was not used more widely
                until the introduction of its three-colour process in 1932.

              <h4><span class="bold">Adding</span> sound</h4>
              <p>
                The first attempts to add synchronised sound to projected
                pictures used phonographic cylinders or discs.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The first feature-length movie incorporating synchronised
                dialogue, The Jazz Singer (USA, 1927), used the Warner Brothers’
                Vitaphone system, which employed a separate record disc with
                each reel of film for the sound.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                This system proved unreliable and was soon replaced by an
                optical, variable density soundtrack recorded photographically
                along the edge of the film.

            In the past 20 years, film production has been profoundly altered by
            the impact of rapidly improving digital technology. Though
            productions may still be shot on film (and even this is becoming
            less commonplace) most subsequent processes, such as editing and
            special effects, are undertaken on computers before the final images
            are transferred back to film. The need for this final transfer is
            diminishing as more cinemas invest in digital projection which is
            capable of producing screen images that rival the sharpness, detail
            and brightness of traditional film projection.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the past few years there has been a revival of interest in 3D
            features, both animated and live action, sparked by the availability
            of digital technology. Whether this will be more than a short-term
            phenomenon (as previous attempts at 3D in the 1950s and 1980s had
            been) remains to be seen.
